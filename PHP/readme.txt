PHP is a language that is used on web servers to merge web page output with optional content or results from a database or user input. Web pages by themselves are static, but intelligence placed on the web server through programs (like PHP) allow a web page to change based on data it gets from the user or from other sources.

PHP is not a stand-alone language, it requires a web server like Apache or IIS to be running to send it the user input. However, it is free to download, and a simple installation includes the Apache web server (also free). When you install this, it runs a small web server on your computer that you can connect to with a local browser, or with other computers on your home or local network.
