Python is a scripting language that is unique from other languages in that it uses indentation of the code to form the if-then-else blocks. 
Other languages will use an explicit start and stop construction, so this shorthand makes the code feel less cluttered. Like Perl, it is supported on all computing platforms (Windows, Unix, Linux, Mac, and mobile devices) and executes immediately without the need for a compile step. 
The simplicity and self-documenting nature of the Python language make it a favorite language for script writers.

Additional libraries can be called from a Python program which gives it access to many pre-built objects such as network connections, databases and graphics.
