Objective-C is a compiled language that is derived from C and is purely object-oriented. All variables are objects, and they are acted upon by sending messages to them. An object is a complex storage structure that can contain complex data and respond to a certain messages, which are determined by the object’s class type. The code syntax is very similar to C++, however sending messages to an object uses sets of brackets to delineate the target object, message, and arguments.

This is a useful language for a Scout to learn because all Apple’s mobile and desktop computers use this as their native language for programs and apps. Also, the programming environment, XCode, is free from Apple Computer. Its only limitation is that it only runs on Mac OSX computers. But if a Scout already has a Mac, it is easy to get started.
